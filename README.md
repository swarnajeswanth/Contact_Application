# Contact_Application
Basic Contact app using Mongodb and Express js


  How to use:
  
    1. Clone the Repository
    
    2. Index.js in the Root Directory is our Entry file
    
    3. use 'nodemon index.js' to run the Express server
    
    4. MongoDb is been used for storing and Retrieving Data from DB
    
    5. Used Font Awesom Library for Icons part . Do check it out the Website , it has some cool Icons available for free . 
  
  
  Disclaimer:
      
        Making it pretty wasn't my exact Idea . So A Basic Styling part was done . I'm sure it doesn't look pretty , But functionality Wise far more than better (Taking about the directory structure for Further scaling and Less Code Redundency)
